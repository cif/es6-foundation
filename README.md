# ES6 Foundation

Because the world clearly needed more ES6 dev boilerplate... :P
This is my light weight, lightly opinionated personal starting point of choice.

# Scripts
`npm run dev` (webpack dev server)
`npm test` (ava test)
`npm build` 

### What's in the box?
* Webpack + Babel + Hot-reloader
* React + Redux
* Eslint (airbnb preset) + AVA + Teaspoon + Proxyquire + Sinon
